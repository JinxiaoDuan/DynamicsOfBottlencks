# DynamicsOfBottlencks
1: About code:

(1) Put code of the bottleneck_dynamics.cpp, and the data in the input file in your project. 

(2) Execute bottleneck_dynamics.cpp or bottleneck_dynamics.exe to calcalate the dynamics of traffic bottlencks in the entire network.

(3) You will receive the results displayed as in the output file.

2: About data:

We uploaded dataset of all the bottleneck dynamics in the Oct. 2015 of Beijing and Shenzhen.

Our dataset concats the results of bottleneck dynamics in one day in a single file.
